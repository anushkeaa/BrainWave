# How the Brain-Computer Interface Detects Left vs Right Thinking

## The Science Behind Motor Imagery Detection

The BCI system isn't actually watching you, tracking your cursor, or counting eye blinks. Instead, it's analyzing patterns in your simulated EEG (brainwave) data.

### The Motor Imagery Principle

When you imagine moving your left hand (without actually moving it):
- The **right** side of your motor cortex becomes more active
- This causes a characteristic change in your brainwaves called "event-related desynchronization" (ERD)
- Specifically, there's a decrease in "mu rhythm" (8-12 Hz) power over the motor cortex

Conversely, when you imagine moving your right hand:
- The **left** side of your motor cortex becomes more active
- Similar ERD patterns appear, but in the opposite hemisphere

### How Our System Identifies This Pattern

1. **Key EEG Channels**: The system focuses on channels C3 (left motor cortex) and C4 (right motor cortex)

2. **Feature Extraction**: The system analyzes:
   - Power in specific frequency bands (particularly 8-12 Hz mu rhythms)
   - Patterns of synchronization and desynchronization
   - Relationships between different brain regions

3. **Machine Learning**: The neural network model learns to recognize these patterns from training data

## In Our Simulation

Since we're using a simulation rather than a real EEG headset:

1. **Simulated Data**: Our backend simulates EEG data that contains these neurophysiological patterns
2. **Alternating Patterns**: The data switches between left and right thinking patterns every 100 samples
3. **The Model**: Still processes this data as if it were real EEG signals

## With Real EEG Hardware

If you were using real EEG hardware (like an OpenBCI or Muse headset):

1. The system would capture real brainwaves from your scalp
2. You would need to calibrate by actually thinking about left and right hand movements
3. The same algorithm would then recognize your specific brain patterns in real-time
